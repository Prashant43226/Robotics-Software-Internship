# Robotics-Software-Internship
Code for path planning and scheduling done as part of OttonomyIO robotics software internship in summer of 2021.




<br/>

• Implemented complete scheduling of a m-robot n pickup drop
Travelling Salesman Problem from scratch.

<br/>

• Used Held Karp algorithm along with optimizations to speed up the
computations by 10x and decrease the memory overheads by 100x.

<br/>

• Also took care of charging constraints,deadlines and hard constraints.

<br/>

• Used optimizations such as local search,tabu search and other
metaheuristics to figure out the most optimal schedule and path for m
robots
